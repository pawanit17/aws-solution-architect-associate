# AWS Cloud Practitioner Exam
- An Amazon EC2 Dedicated Host is a physical server with EC2 instance capacity fully dedicated to your use. 
  Dedicated Hosts allow you to use your existing per-socket, per-core, or per-VM software licenses, including Windows Server, 
  Microsoft SQL Server, SUSE, and Linux Enterprise Server.
- AWS Trusted Advisor provides recommendations that help you follow AWS best practices. Trusted Advisor evaluates your account by using checks.
- AWS Cost Explorer has an easy-to-use interface that lets you visualize, understand, and manage your AWS costs and usage over time.
- Amazon CloudWatch is a performance monitoring service. AWS services send metrics about their utilization to CloudWatch which collects the metrics. 
  Additionally, CloudWatch collects metrics about account activity such as billing information which can also be viewed.
- AWS CloudTrail is an auditing service that monitors API activity in your account. Whenever you perform any operation in the account this results 
  in an API action and this information is recorded to create an audit trail.
- AWS Artifact is your go-to, central resource for compliance-related information that matters to you. It provides on-demand access to AWS’ security and 
  compliance reports and select online agreements. Reports available in AWS Artifact include our Service Organization Control (SOC) reports, Payment Card Industry (PCI)
  reports, and certifications from accreditation bodies across geographies and compliance verticals that validate the implementation and operating effectiveness of AWS security controls.
- It is a security best practice to rotate access keys regularly. This practice ensures that if access keys are compromised the security exposure is mitigated.
- The company would like to keep management overhead to a minimum so RDS would be good to meet that requirement. However, with RDS you cannot access the operating system so the requirement for running scripts on the OS rules RDS out. 
  Therefore, the next best solution is to deploy on an Amazon EC2 instances as the other options presented are unsuitable for a relational database.
- An Amazon Relational Database Service (RDS) deployment across multiple availability zones is a good example of using the reliability pillar of the AWS Well-Architected Framework. 
  The specific design principle being followed here is “Automatically recover from failure”.
- AWS Budgets allows you to set custom budgets to track your cost and usage from the simplest to the most complex use cases.
- Amazon Inspector is an automated security assessment service that helps improve the security and compliance of applications deployed on AWS.
- Point-in-time recovery (PITR) provides continuous backups of your DynamoDB table data. When enabled, DynamoDB maintains incremental backups of your table for the 
  last 35 days until you explicitly turn it off. It is a customer responsibility to enable PITR on and AWS is responsible for actually performing the backups.
- AWS Outposts is a fully managed service that offers the same AWS infrastructure, AWS services, APIs, and tools to virtually any datacenter, 
  co-location space, or on-premises facility for a truly consistent hybrid experience. With AWS Outposts you can extend your VPC into the on-premises data center as in the following diagram:
 - Scheduled scaling helps you to set up your own scaling schedule according to predictable load changes. 
   For example, let's say that every week the traffic to your web application starts to increase on Wednesday, remains high on Thursday, 
   and starts to decrease on Friday. You can configure a schedule for Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling to increase capacity on Wednesday and decrease capacity on Friday.
 - Quick Starts are built by Amazon Web Services (AWS) solutions architects and partners to help you deploy popular technologies on AWS, based on AWS best practices for security and high availability. 
   These accelerators reduce hundreds of manual procedures into just a few steps, so you can build your production environment quickly and start using it immediately.
